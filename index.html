        <h1>FUCK JFishing</h1>
        <p>I think JFishing is very evil. His plugin monopolizes the entire BDS anti-cheat market and implements a fee system. This capitalist JFishing rapes other free anti-cheat authors. So please help me to against him</p>
        <p>JFishing, you fool, do you think that attacking my website will prevent me from continuing to crack your plug-in? Your authorization system sucks, and I cracked it in a few hours. I know it is difficult for you to update the plug-in to 1.17.10, wait for a few days, wait for you to update to the new version, I will continue to crack</p>
        <p>Didn't you know that I was the one who snatched your domain name until today? I have noticed you a long time ago. Until May 20th this year, I immediately grabbed your domain name. It only cost five dollars, which is really cheap. I take your domain name to show cracked AntiCheats plugin, you must be mad now</p>
